# Implementing Dribbble Invite

## Intro

In this video, I'm going to demonstrate how to implement a dribbble invite form like this in HTML and CSS.

Hi, I'm Juntao. I'm a developer and an author. I've published several books on Web Development, mainly on React, Clean Code and Design.

To get the most out of the content, you launch your editor and follow the steps here. If you haven't set up your environment, I've created a video here for you [link here].

Let's get started.
